Joint Program - Applicant and Support Knowledgbase (JP-ASK)
======
I have been involved in [JP-ASK](https://mit.whoi.edu/admissions/apply/jp-applicant-service-knowledgebase-jp-ask/) as a mentor since 2021 and have served on the excecutive board since 2022. JP-ASK is a mentorship program that matches current JP graduate students with prospective students. The main goal of JP-ASK is to diversify the geosciences by providing mentorship to underrepresented groups.

Penikese Island School
======
I have been a Guest instructor at the [Girls' Nature + Science Camp](https://www.penikese.org/camp) since summer 2022. [Katy Abbott](https://katyabbott.github.io/), Margaret Gregory, and I co-teach a lesson about Buoyancy, Density, and Mixing. The goal of the camp is to "empower middle-school girls and gender-expansive youth in the sciences by providing them with role models of women in STEM, and to foster confidence in science, in nature, and in themselves".

Letters to a Pre-scientist
======
[Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org/about-us/) facilitates one-on-one connections to humanize STEM professionals, demystify STEM career pathways, and inspire all students to explore a future in STEM via a Pen Pal exchange of letters. I have been a STEM professional correspondent since fall 2022.

Woods Hole Science Stroll
======
Once a year, all major [marine science and educational institutions in Woods Hole](https://woodsholesciencestroll.org/) open their doors to the public to educate, engage, and showcase their science and work. I helped run the CTD booth this Summer 2023 where I talked to members of the general public about oceanography.
