Joint Program - Applicant and Support Knowledgbase (JP-ASK)
======
I have been involved in [JP-ASK](https://mit.whoi.edu/admissions/apply/jp-applicant-service-knowledgebase-jp-ask/) as a mentor since 2021 and have served on the excecutive board since 2022. JP-ASK is a mentorship program that matches current JP graduate students with prospective students. The main goal of JP-ASK is to diversify the geosciences by providing mentorship to primarily underrepresented groups in this field.

Penikese Island School
======
I have been a Guest instructor at the [Girls' Nature + Science Camp](https://www.penikese.org/camp) since summer 2022. Katy Abbott, Margaret Gregory, and myself co-teach a lesson about Buoyancy, Density, and Mixing. The goal of the camp is to "empower middle-school girls and gender-expansive youth in the sciences by providing them with role models of women in STEM, and to foster confidence in science, in nature, and in themselves". <br/><img src='/images/penikese2023_logo.png' width="500">

Letters to a Pre-scientist
======
[Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org/about-us/) facilitates one-on-one connections to humanize STEM professionals, demystify STEM career pathways, and inspire all students to explore a future in STEM via a Pen Pal exchange of letters. I have been a STEM professional correspondent since fall 2022. <br/><img src='/images/lps_logo.png' width="500">
