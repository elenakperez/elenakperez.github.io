I am a 3rd year Physical Oceanography PhD student in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](https://mit.whoi.edu/) advised by [Magdalena Andres](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mandres/) and [Glen Gawarkiewicz](https://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/people/ggg/). I passed my PhD qualifying exams in June 2023. After my exams, I finished up a project on Gulf Stream rings that [I will present at OSM 2024](https://agu.confex.com/agu/OSM24/meetingapp.cgi/Person/1478517). I also recently submitted the manuscript, "Is the Regime Shift in Gulf Stream Warm Core Rings Detected by Satellite Altimetry? An Inter-comparison of Eddy Identification and Tracking Products," to JGR Oceans. After OSM 2024, I plan to present my thesis proposal in March 2024 to my thesis committee. Some of my past research projects include: [understanding drivers of marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97012-0), analyzing variability of Gulf Stream rings using sea surface height products, and modeling the relationship of the Shelf Break Jet to sea level variabililty on the U.S. NE coast. I am particularly interested in climate variability, mesoscale to large-scale ocean dynamics, sea level change, and extreme events. 

In my free time, I enjoy biking around Cape Cod and Boston, walking in nature, swimming, listening to podcasts, and reading. During the summer I do pottery and in the winter I (attempt to work on my) knit(ting projects).
