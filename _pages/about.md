I am a 3rd year PhD student of Physical Oceanography in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science and Engineering](https://mit.whoi.edu/) advised by [Magdalena Andres](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mandres/). Recently, I passed my PhD qualifying exams in June 2023 and am starting to write my theis proposal, which I will present in December 2023. My past projects include: [understanding drivers of marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97012-0), analyzing variability of Gulf Stream warm core and cold core rings with sea surface height products, and modeling the relationship of the Shelf Break Jet to sea level variabililty on the Northeast U.S. coast. Currently, I am writing the manuscript for the rings project to be submit by end of summer 2023. Some of my scientific interests are climate variability, mesoscale to large-scale ocean dynamics, sea level change, and western boundary currents. 

In my free time, I enjoy biking around Cape Cod and Boston, walking in nature, swimming, listening to podcasts, reading, pottery in the summer and knitting in the winter.
