I am a 3rd year Physical Oceanography PhD student in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](https://mit.whoi.edu/) advised by [Magdalena Andres](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mandres/). Recently, I passed my PhD qualifying exams in June 2023. At the moment, I'm finishing up a project and then I will start to write my thesis proposal which I will present in December 2023. My past research projects include: [understanding drivers of marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97012-0), analyzing variability of Gulf Stream warm core and cold core rings with sea surface height products, and modeling the relationship of the Shelf Break Jet to sea level variabililty on the Northeast U.S. coast. The manuscript I am writing up for submission  by the end of summer 2023 is the Gulf Stream rings project. Some of my scientific interests are in climate variability, mesoscale to large-scale ocean dynamics, sea level change, and extreme events. 

In my free time, I enjoy biking around Cape Cod and Boston, walking in nature, swimming, listening to podcasts, reading, pottery in the summer and knitting in the winter.
