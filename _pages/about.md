I am a 3rd year Physical Oceanography PhD student in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](https://mit.whoi.edu/) advised by [Magdalena Andres](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mandres/). Recently, I passed my PhD qualifying exams in June. Currently, I'm finishing up a project and will then begin my thesis proposal which I will present in December 2023. Some of my research projects include: [understanding drivers of marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97012-0), analyzing variability of Gulf Stream rings using sea surface height products, and modeling the relationship of the Shelf Break Jet to sea level variabililty on the U.S. NE coast. I am particularly interested in climate variability, mesoscale to large-scale ocean dynamics, sea level change, and extreme events. 

In my free time, I enjoy biking around Cape Cod and Boston, walking in nature, swimming, listening to podcasts, reading, pottery in the summer and knitting in the winter.
