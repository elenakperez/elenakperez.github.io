I am a 4th year Physical Oceanography PhD student in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](https://mit.whoi.edu/) advised by [Magdalena Andres](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mandres/) and [Glen Gawarkiewicz](https://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/people/ggg/). After I passed my PhD qualifying exams last June, 2023,submitted a manuscript ot JGR Oceans, entitled "Is the Regime Shift in Gulf Stream Warm Core Rings Detected by Satellite Altimetry? An Inter-comparison of Eddy Identification and Tracking Products," on work on Gulf Stream rings which is Chapter 1 of my thesis. I gave a presentation of my thesis proposal to my thesis committee in April 2024 and am now working on what will become Chapter 2 of the thesis. Broadly, my Chapter 2 will focus on extending the time-series of the Gulf Stream daily position and exploring the variability of the Gulf Stream path.

Some of my past research projects include: [understanding drivers of marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97012-0), analyzing variability of Gulf Stream rings using sea surface height products, and modeling the relationship of the Shelf Break Jet to sea level variabililty on the U.S. NE coast. I am particularly interested in climate variability, mesoscale to large-scale ocean dynamics, sea level change, and extreme events. 

In my free time, I enjoy biking around Cape Cod and Boston, walking in nature, swimming, listening to podcasts, and reading. During the summer I do pottery and in the winter I (attempt to work on my) knit(ting projects).
